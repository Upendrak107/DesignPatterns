 OBSERVER DESIGN PATTERN
 =====================================
 As name suggest it’s used to observe things.
 Observer design pattern in Java is a fundamental core Java pattern where Observer watch for any change in state
 or property of Subject.
 For Example : - Company updates all its shareholders for any decision they make, 
 here Company is Subject and Shareholders are Observers, 
 any change in policy of company and Company notifies all its Shareholders or Observer
 
 This is beautiful pattern and used heavily along with Model View Controller Design pattern where change in model is propagated to view,
 so that it can render it with modified information.
 
 Advantage of Observer Design Pattern in Java: 
 ===============================================
Main advantage is loose coupling between objects called observer and observable. 
The subject only know the list of observers it don’t care about how they have their implementation.
All the observers are notified by subject in a single event call as Broadcast communication
